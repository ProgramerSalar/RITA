That's theworld of denotational semantics.Back in the day, programming languagemeanings were often vague, leading tobugs and confusion. But then brilliantminds like Christopher Stretchy and DanaScott asked what if we could map everypiece of code, a number, an operation, aloop directly to a precise mathematicalconcept. This gave us denotationalsemantics, assigning a clear, undeniablemathematical meaning to code.

SoI myself had a lot of difficulty in the audit.It used to happen that I studied on the first day and the second day would gocompletely blank.  But I think you just have to keep doing itagain and againuntil you understand because the language of auditis not Indian English.English of It's Abroad.  So he adapted tolike to learn that type of English.It's very difficult because it's the firsttime.  Once you have done some foundation in law, then onsimilar lines you should at leastremember the provisions.  But Ithink I had a little difficulty in learning the languagein the initialdays.  But this is how it used to be, suppose today Ispent four hours for the audit.  And I couldn't remember yesterday.I had to put back four hours.So audit was very time consumingfor me also.

We knowthat a solid is one that has afixed size, fixed shape, andfixed volume. A solid is a compoundmade of an element. Supposewe have a box made of a fixed compound, i.e.,iron. That iron is made of fissile molecules,and thosemolecules are made upof atoms. Now, this was a very interesting question in 17th centurysolid state physics:how do solids remain in their fixed size and shape?Why don't they separate like liquids and gases?It was believed that there is anintermolecular force between the molecules of a solid,which is stronger than that of a liquid and a gas,and it keeps them closed.Remember, theforce between molecules is anintermolecular force, and the atomsfrom which molecules the molecules are made are called atoms.  They are made up of atoms and there is anintermolecular force between them.",

These tyres aredesigned for dry conditions and can't run on water at all, butthey have excellent grip on a dry track. Thesecond is a grooved tyre, which isused for dam conditions and wetconditions. If you pour water on this tyre, thewater will pass through these grooves,maintaining the tyre's grip on the track. Next comes a deeper groovedtyre, with deeper grooves.These tyres are useful when there's a lot ofwater on the track. Thistype can literally cross 85 litres of water per second at aspeed of 300 km/h andmaintains good grip on the track.Like the video and subscribe to Life Stick.",

There isa sequence in these four Vedas and let us understand how this sequence is so wellorganized.Friends, the first Veda, Rigveda,describes the nature, qualities and actions of matter.That is why it is also called Gyan Kand, that is,in the direction of specific knowledge, we should firststudy nature and its qualities.Then comes Yajurveda. Now, afterstudying matter and its nature, it has to beconverted into action, which means now it has to be donepractically. Therefore,rituals are the main subject in Yajurveda. Now, the scholars of Rigveda get theunderstanding of God's creation through the Karma Yoga of Yajurveda, due to whichdevotional feelings arise. Therefore, themantras of the Samaveda that come next are music-oriented andtheir subject is devotional worship. For this reason,Shri Krishna himself has said in Bhagwat Geetathat I am Samaveda among the Vedas.Gyan Yoga, Karma Yoga and devotionalVidyasik give rise to special knowledgewhich is called science, that is why Atharva Vedais the last Veda, its subject is science,friends, I hope",

I havebrought such questions for you thatafter solving them, your logic building problem will besolved to a great extent. So basicallyfor logic building, you have to start with avery normal question likethis: print 1 1 3 5 orprint stars in this shape like apple. This isour first question. What is there in this?First one is printed then 1 then 1 2 3 then1. Basically, this is every new line. So,for new lines, a loop will be used. Second, I need tomake this output. For this,another loop will be used. First, I need to make a loop for theouter lines, in which five lines willcome. I will lock the console here and see what is thevalue of aa. 1 2 3 45 is correct. One line has been formed from top to bottom,but to print the content inside, let'smake a separate loop for that. For loopj = 1 j should be less.  dan i 5 j + pr If Iprint j now, what will be my output?All lines will be cut like this 3 5 2 3First, I will have to bring this in one line.What will I do in this, I will create a new string.So first, by creating that string completely,then from the cursor I pi s that Ican put j. q j i 1 3 5 rt And now I willprint the string every time.But what I want is that the first v should bet. So basically, if youlook at the logic, then line number one is one, linenumber two is one and two, line number three is one, twoand three. So it is working onthe line number, line number one. The loop which isour i, so instead of j, it shouldgo till line number five. Basically,if I run it, now I will search forlogic building patterns, then I will get manypatterns. Solve them.Learn logic building and all set.",

We know that it is a single card, sohow will we arrange it? So, leave two aside like this.After that comes our second card.In the second card, we have S. Whenwe talk about our S, S is smaller than two. So,what will we do? We will pick it up andplace it before two. So, this bundle of one and two isformed for us, which is a sorted part.Both of them are sorted. After that, we go toour third card, in which we havefive. We know that one and two isbigger than both. Now, these three areformed as a part, which is according to its shortcut.After that,we go to the four card above the first card.Four is placed in its correct position.We know that four is smaller than five, so it willcome ahead of five but bigger than one and two.  Sothis must have been behind one and two, in thisway this became a part of ours which isour shortest in which one, you, four andfive, after that let's talk about three, toarrange three we know that three issmaller than five, so it will come before five, if three is smallerthan four then it will come before four also andone is bigger than two, then three will come here, inthis way finally these cards of ours will goup in range to us in short and fashionand in this way wesorted them, in this way andrange we sorted them insertion",

If you are doing thistoday, then you are not asintelligent as you think you arebecause if you do not do your NCERTfirst and before that you jump to French books, thenyou are wasting both your time and energy.Second is RDSharma Bhaiya.

Hey Bhaiya, what are you saying?NCERT is the most important, it isabsolutely important, but if you arefollowing NCERT  If you have studied the same NCERT and are reading the same NCERT 10times, then it willnot improve your marks.Read the NCERT once or twice and thenpractice the questions becauseNCERT does not come in the exam.

Let'ssay we are given the names of 100,000 people.One way is to giveus all the names in a list,and the other way is to giveus all the names written in a dictionary,starting with A, then B, then C. Inthis way, ifwe are told to find our name, it will be easier tofind it in which one.Obviously, it will be easier for us to find it in the dictionarybecause we can match the first letter of our name, whether itappears at the beginning or the end of the dictionary.This concept of binary search algorithm in coding works in such a waythat if we haveall the numbers written in ascending fashion from one to 10 andwe want to find the number eight, then tofind it, instead of looking at each number one by one, we willdivide our list into two partsand find the middle one.  Themiddle one is five. Now the number eight that we have tofind is greater than five, so we donot need to check it in the first list, we will directly pick up the second one andcheck in that. Now to check in the second list also,we will divide it into two piecesand take out our middle one andin the middle of these two pieces we will find ournumber eight. Now there isno need to find the left part, we need tofind the right part, so in this wayour magnetic reduces the coding.",

So,brother, three willnot be the answer because we have to take variation, so thecombination here will be that and the answeris possible. We have to solve this, so 9factorial upon 6 * 3, this will be the answer here,which will come here, 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 andyour 6 factorial will be cancelled. For 3factorial, we will write three, so this iscancelled, this will become 3 * 3 = m, this will beforced up. So, if we solve this, theanswer comes out to be 84. So,we can make 84 such comedians.

Generally speaking,landing gear isextremely robust and can withstand thecrosswind forces imposed by crab landing.Then, once the aircraftis on the ground, you bring it back into line with the runway.

But human strength, so maybein Yugi's domain,whoever enters Yugi's domain, his hardtechnique, his hard energy will become absolutely null,and then the fight will be based on pure strength.And you also know what level Yugi's physical strength is.

Even the higher officers respected him.He was so strong that even Kazak had toseal him before the Shibuya Incident. So thequestion arises: despite being so powerful,how did he lose to Sukuna? I knowthis must have crossed your mind at some point. Theanswer is quite simple.Sukuna was a Sirs of Hi Nera and had alot of battle experience compared toGojo. Sukuna also knewhow powerful Gojo was andknew almost all of his techniques.That's why Sukuna hired Megami to defeat Gojo.Meaning, Sukunaplayed smartly, but on the other hand, Gojopreferred to fight solo and evenunderestimated Sukuna, just likehe did Toji.Gojo fought very well in one battle, but ifhe wanted, he could have easily defeated Sukuna with the help of Yuta.Is thestrongest vice should only be helped by othersand this attitude also became the reason for his endand if you are also a Gojo fan and agree with me",

Guys, thisamplifier boardis quite trending and you can see thatit looks like a simple music player but it hasa big heat sink at the backand you can give it power from 8 volts to 24 volts.Then you can get an output of 50 plus 50 volts from it.Meaning that if you total it, youcan get an output of 100 volts.  Guys,in this amplifier board weget inbuilt Bluetooth and along with this wealso get to see this remote with the help of which we cancontrol it.  So guys, if you want, youcan also run it with a 12 volt adapter, but for better output,I am going to connect this laptop charger with it.So guys, I havecompleted all its connections and youcan see that the light has also come on in it.So I quickly connect it to the phoneand play the song.Come tonight[music]",

Thefirst question asked what is thevalue of two to the power of four. Thethird question asked what is the value of eight to the power of eight.Your examiner may need to go up to eight,and he has done thisin different papers. You just need to know this. So,my brother, whenever you double the power, you have to subtract two from the wholesquare of the previous number. So,what do you have to do here, my brother, if you subtract two from the whole square of three, then what willit become? Seven. Similarly, mybrother, double of two is four. So,what will you do here with the whole square of two? If you subtract two,it will become 47. Then double of four is eight. So,here, my brother, you will subtract two from the whole square of 47. Thewhole square of 47 is2209.  And if yousubtract two from 2209, what will it become? It will become 22207. If youunderstand what I am saying, thenyou have to keep these small things in mindthat you will subtracttwo from the whole square of the number whose number you are doubling. Okay, ifwe do this in the case of plus, then we do itin the case of plus.",

You show it thousands ofimages, but one weird photo, a cat in ahat, could throw off the learning.Gradient clipping acts like a speedlimit, preventing wild updates. Buthere's the twist. It also boostsprivacy. By adding noise to training, wehide individual data like a shield.Traditional methods force the speedlimit clipping threshold to grow overtime, weakening privacy. This researchfixes that by using a fixed clippinglevel, keeping privacy strong whilesimplifying real world AI. Here's themagic. Under the right conditions, thismethod doesn't just stabilize learning,it accelerates it. By balancing noiseand clipping bias, models avoid crashesand zoom toward peak performance. Thisisn't theory. It works for everythingfrom image recognition to self-drivingcars. Privacy and speed. Now, that's thefuture of AI.",

Now I have been given some conditions and some events.I have to tell their probability.So what is probability?Probability is favourable outcomesdivided by total outcomes. Nowwhat are the favourable outcomes that I want.Like in this question let us understand n evennumbers. So which are the even numbers? Here there istwo, four and six. These numbers aresatisfying me for even numbers. SoI had asked you first how will youfind the probability. How many favourable outcomes are there? 3divided by total outcomes. How many total outcomes are there.Here you can see six.As soon as I solve this further, what will come out to be1/2. Similarly, there should be n even numbers and evennumbers. And what should be amultiple of three? So here  But you will see thatthis is not a multiple of three, thisis not a multiple of three, just whatis six, that is, what is the favourable outcome,here only my one, so what will be theanswer to the second question, one bywhat is the total outcomes, six and this ismy answer, now the thirdquestion is number greater than three,you can write its answer in the comment box.",

Now I have been given some conditions and some events.I have to tell their probability.So what is probability?Probability is favourable outcomesdivided by total outcomes. Nowwhat are the favourable outcomes that I want.Like in this question let us understand n evennumbers. So which are the even numbers? Here there istwo, four and six. These numbers aresatisfying me for even numbers. SoI had asked you first how will youfind the probability. How many favourable outcomes are there? 3divided by total outcomes. How many total outcomes are there.Here you can see six.As soon as I solve this further, what will come out to be1/2. Similarly, there should be n even numbers and evennumbers. And what should be amultiple of three? So here  But you will see thatthis is not a multiple of three, thisis not a multiple of three, just whatis six, that is, what is the favourable outcome,here only my one, so what will be theanswer to the second question, one bywhat is the total outcomes, six and this ismy answer, now the thirdquestion is number greater than three,you can write its answer in the comment box.",

Ifyou move the character right up againstthe wall, though, you'll notice thatpart of the gun goes inside the wall.And so, what you should be seeing infirst person perspective is the front ofyour gun clipping into the wall. But invirtually all FPS games, the gun isfully visible at all times, no matterhow close you are to the wall. How isthis possible? One of the most commonways to get around gun clipping issimply by rendering the gun completelyseparately from the rest of the gameworld. It's basically like taking avideo and slapping a picture on top ofit so that it always shows up on top ofwhatever else is happening in the game.In this example, the gun is technicallyclipping into the wall, but it doesn'tlook like it because it exists in acompletely separate universe.[Music]",

So the speed of the train hasreduced by how much? 8 km has reduced, that is,x -8. This is the time and what is the difference between these times?3 hours. The difference of 3 hours is that the longertime minus the shorter time is 3 hours.What is the longer time? 480 / x - 8 480 / x =3. All we have to do is solve this. The speed of thetrain is 40.

So the speed of the train hasreduced by how much? 8 km has reduced, that is,x -8. This is the time and what is the difference between these times?3 hours. The difference of 3 hours is that the longertime minus the shorter time is 3 hours.What is the longer time? 480 / x - 8 480 / x =3. All we have to do is solve this. The speed of thetrain is 40.  If you want to understand this conceptbetter thenwatch the detailed video of word problems of quadratic equation.",

This is wheremy first reason comes in: learning to code helpsus create new ideas andrealize new things.

Thisprinciple rooted in the second law ofthermodynamics suggests that theuniverse generally moves towards greaterdisorder or entropy. Yet paradoxically,life itself represents a curious riseagainst this gradient where livingorganisms create order from chaos. Thisfundamental contradiction leaves uspondering, how does life emerge andthrive in a universe seemingly destinedfordisorder? As scientists probe deeper,they uncover that local decreases inentropy might be sustained by largersystems increasing their disorder, acaptivating dance of balance andcontrast.Such exploration into entropy not onlyunravels the mysteries of our universebut also touches on the very nature ofexistence itself.",

What is the simple meaning of random?When yousee the NCERT text book, you say that solid,liquid and gas, then the entropy of gasmolecules is more far apart, but when youread the formula, you write deltas = q / t, does it mean that thehigher the temperature, the lower will be the entropy,whereas it should be the opposite, with theincrease in temperature, the molecules willmove faster, so the entropy shouldincrease, thenwhy is delta equal q ba t ba t written in the formula,you have to answer this today.",

But here also thereis a contradiction i.e. a paradox becausewe can never generate energy.According to the Law of Conservation of Energy, only onetype of energy can be converted into another type.Therefore, there isa limited amount of energy in the universe which willneither decrease nor increase. So, it is theenergy of the universe which we use tomaintain things around usand all this is not limited to science.Philosophically, if you donot make some effort from your side, then you too willdefinitely go to hell.[Music]",

If you look at these thingscarefully, some work was done on the piston due to my applying heat, that is why it was able tomove from bottom to top, that means there is some relation between heat andwork anddue to my applying heat, the temperature of the gases alsoincreased.

Somepeople are entropic. Suppose everything in your room isuniformed,everything is arranged in order. Yourbedsheets are absolutely uniform, your kurtas are neatly arranged,and your desk, studytable, all the books arearranged, pens are kept in the holder,everything is in order. What will happenwhen you use that room, everything willmove from its place and things will become non-uniform. Bedsheets will become non-uniform,kurtas will become non-uniform,things on your study table will also becomemessed up. Now, entropyis the creation of order in anything into disorder.This is called entropy. Entropymoves to disorderliness, disorderliness nevermoves to order. That is whyyou will have to use extra energy tobring things back into order. So,entropy is the degree ofrandomness.",

Sotoday I will tell you how it can be easy for you andhow to learn it.First of all, clear all the fundamentals of your requirementand the good questions which involvemultiplecalls from one to the other, basic questions like makingseries, measure path, keep all of them in clarity,after that, it is like memorization, okay,this is nothing, in the process you will justmemorize it and you will learn it easily.After this, your DP will start building a little bit,then doing grid problemsseems quite easy, you will learn tabulation from it.Do these in top down also, domap questions, do LCSquestions, after that DP onstrings, edit distance, now someI am including this in this, then you have to do MCM,after this your DP will almost be over, if you dosome more questions along with DP on trees and bit marks",

Recursion means calling the function itself, while caching means storing the intermediate resultsBottom-up approachIt solves the same kind of problems but it removes the recursion. If we remove the recursion, there is no stack overflow issue and no overhead of the recursive functions",

According to Charles Darwin,evolution is a result ofsmall changes, which are called variations.These variations are slow,heritable, and directional.What does direction mean? If variations occurin the body of a living organism toadapt to changing environmental conditions,then these variations will bepassed on to the next generation, and then to the nextgeneration.Once variations occur in the body of an individual,they will definitely occur in the next generation. There isno turning back and asequential pattern is followed.Whereas, according to Ugadi Bridge, evolution is aresult of large changes, random changes,which are called mutations. Thesevariations are random and directional.Charles Darwin had said that thesevariations are small changes, butHugo said that speciation is new.Single step largemutation salutation is responsible for the formation of species in thisway state you by for video",

Tosolve this issue, gears were added toallow one wheel to stop while the otheris driven. However, due to the largeangle, the gears lose contact with eachother. Therefore, additional gears wereadded to allow one wheel to stop and theother to rotate. Finally, a drive shaftis added to provide the necessary powerto rotate the wheels.",
