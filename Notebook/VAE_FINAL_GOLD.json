As soon as srinivasa ramanujan saw the question, he told the answer.He said the answer will be three.He said we can write three under\u221a9, we can write 9, we can write 1 + 8 then 8, wecan write 2 and 4 and \u221a1again, we will write 16, we will write 1 + 15, then we will write 15, in place of 3 * 5 then 5 we will write \u221a2. in this way, a series will be formed which will be exactly the same as the question, hence the answer will be three because this series is made up of three.Now think for yourself and see this ramanujan had formulated the question as soon as he saw it. What a brain he must have had."

So what is mean?Now you understand the mean. You have been given a question to solve it. You have to find the mean.You add all of them and count how many values \u200b\u200bare there. There are five values, divide by five.Add this and solve it. Your mean is found.Here you have to find the median what will be your first step? You will arrange it in ascending or descending order. I did itin ascending order. I cut the last from the first and Icut the second last from the second this is what happened to you. You got the median.One more question has been given. What will you do if the value is more? You have arranged all these in ascending order. the first one is cut off the last one and the second last one is cut off. What did you do? You did 4 +7. In up, you did 2. the answer given is 11/2, what did you get? 5.5,this is what you got, the median is what you got. now you see the mode. A question has been given to find the mode. In this, see what has come the most number of times. See once, twice, thrice,so what will be your mode? Your mode will be 8.Why are your two marks confirmed only these questions are going to come."

Today I am going to develop a technique in which you will not have to memorize it. What to do after starting the car, ifany function is given, you just have to write f0 here, then f0 =1 * x, then f0 = 2 * x, it will continue like this, you can take it as far as you want. inflating comes,for example, if you are given a function e to the power xand you have to write its expansion, then when you differentiate e to the power x, then if you do eto the power x again, then e to the power x will come, every time you put e to the power x, it will becomeone. In this way, what will be the expansion of c to the power x,f01 +1/1 means in x and then it will become x = /ft 2 x c / ft 3 and this will continue, okay,thank you. You"

It is also known as Rat effect. It is also known as allelic drift okay so genetic drift isthe random fluctuation In the past, if a distinct change occurs, then we call it genetic drift. What happens in genetic drift? It isthe process ofby chance. The process that takes place in genetic drift,if we understand what genetic drift is, then let's take the most common example. Okay,you have a population of insects, in which there are white insects as well as black insects. the population of white insects died through our food. Okay,this random process took place and now what is left, only black insects are left. So, the population of those insects, the white colour in it The frequency of the genes of these got changed okay now only the black ones are left, so the black ones will go ahead and survive, they will mate and their population will also become black in the future,so suddenly there was a change in the frequency of their genes which existed before."

To find this arrange all the numbers in ascending or descending order and the number between them is the median. But iftwo numbers are in the middle, then add both of them and divide by 2.

See,what is the relation between these two in a linear pair and if this is in a linear pair, then both should be summed up to 180. when this angle is of 135 degrees, then how much will this be? This will be of45 degrees. Now tell mewho is making this 45 degree angle look this arc is making it. Now,what is this in the case of this arc? It is the rest part of thecircle. And this arc is the rest part of thecircle. See, this makes an angle of x.Okay, and we know that the angle made by any arc at the centre is double of the angle made in the rest part of the circle.

Now pick up your pencil, but not to draw lines, but to practice Now keep practicing in circles like this without touching the paper. keep practicing until you feel your hand is rotating 360\u00b0.And when the motion becomes smooth then you confidently draw a circle.

The area of \u200b\u200bthe triangle willcome, there is no easier way to do it in the whole world,you just show me how to do it with this method."

It will be 200.Now what will be the sum of this outer angle and this inner angle 360 will be the complete angle.

We have to make pairs.We always start making pairs from the back. Sohere, two and nine form the pair together. only one number is left ahead, so we will put a single wire on it. Now see, you will always solve this in years, like first of all a goes to five. So by multiplying it by which we always find the square. Like this 1 2 12 * 4 * 3 9, then nine will become bigger, so we will take four. So the complete result of two in two is 5 - 4a basically now we have to carefully see which number comes here, which is two plus two, that is, two plus two, which will always be there here.So here you and two, like this two plus two become four. So four we have now a.Now we have to multiply it likehere, the number here and the number here should beby two. See here But you do it, then you will do it with 2 * 2 = 4 2 * 4 = 8 similarly, instead of2 we took three, so here also three was there region nine three four goes 12 129, so here we wrote three here nine,so from here we have to find out that its square root will be 23, okay, you must be doing this in other such questions how do you make videos in the comment section, make videos on the topic"

So, we are dealing in mode seven.So, we are going to now divide 101 by 7.This will give us 14 full weeks remainder three. Our focus is on this remainder That means 101 is equivalent to 3 in mode 7. So to find the day ofthe week it will be 101 days is 3 days after Saturday. So we have sunday monday Tuesday. therefore the day ofthe week it will be in 101 days. It'sgoing to be on a Tuesday.

So, to solve this question, you have to check which number is greater than Noida on the two table. We will not consider the negative side. So, if the number greater than Noida is1010 out of 10, then we will check92, our answer will be one. similarly in 2070 mode five, we will check the number greater than 2017,which is divisible by five. It is a number greater than 227. If we subtract 3227, then our answer will be three. similarly in the third mode, we will check which number is greater than 1000 on the four table. If we subtract 1200 from 1000, then the answer will be two. Similarly, you have to tell us by commenting what will be the answer for the fourth part."

The correct answer for this was option number two but you must be thinking oh friend how can option number two be the answer for this.So see two times 100 means 2* 2 * 2 * 2 * how many times 100 times and half means divide by two.When you halve anything by two, it means divide by two.Now you see, two is subtracted from two. nowhere you see how many twos are there. Here,total 100 is there. How many were there in 100, one has been subtracted from that. So tell me how many times two has gone back.99 times it has gone back.

What i think is really cool though is what happens, if I heat this whole thing up with a hair dryer.All the CO2 eventually goes supercritical andit turns into something, that's kind of a liquid and a gas, at the same time.

Now let'smake the frame of the drone.I'm using ice cream sticks to make the frame by gluing them together in a plush shape. You'llglue the DC motors around the frame one by one connect the plus-plus and minus minus wires of all four motors in one place to make the drone wireless. To make it wireless, I'll use a remote control If you want it, I've provided the billing in the comments section, so you can buy it from there. Friends,if you also like making projects with DC motors, then be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel.Do tell me in the comments how many motors you have friends I'll put a small lithium battery inside this drone.Now this drone is ready to fly. you can also turn it on and off with the remote control."

So what is this? I have total outcomes Now let's reach the favourable outcomes the probability of two heads is that I am seeing two heads at the same place, that means what is my favourable outcome? That means my one and total outcomes that means four, that means 1/4.Where is one tail visible? One here, onehere, that means what is my favourable outcomes two and total outcomes, that means1/2. Now these two questions that have come up are most confusing, here we will see at most and at least, at most means at mostone, at most one means at most how many"

        "subtitle": "Hello everyone, in this video it is explained how to find square root using long division method.To find square root using long division method you should at least have learnt square root.In the first question, while doing the question, you have to divide the question at unit place.You get normal division55 and get six and write this as 36. you have to add both of these 5 + 5 = 10. Now the number that comes here, we have to multiply this number by the number below andwe will find the answer.Now we have to see in which units place six is \u200b\u200bthere, soin the units place of the square of 64 and six is there for the minutes of the square of six.So we first check the four by taking 4 * 4 =16. 4 * 1 = 4. If we do not give which is using six sixor 36 6 * 1 = 6, the answer will be56. Similarly, do the second half of the question number and tell the answer in the comment box. thanks for watching"

No use of normal table We will use 6 square 36. write six at the top 6 on left side plus 6 and add these 2 6 gives us 12. 44 - 36 is 8.Next pair 89 we bring down. So we have889. Write 889 we write one digit to right of 12. If we write 1 multiply itby 1. If we write 2 122 * 2 123 * 3 goon till you reach 889. 127 into 7 gives us 889. 7 as a quotient at the top.Write 7 next to 12 + add 7 gives us 134which is half of quotient 67. this confirms our answer and square root of4489 is 67."

So the square of 0 is smaller than 7. We will take the leg of 0 below and add these two and0. Now we will put such a number behind which this number will be formed. If I put 8 with 44,it becomes 48 and Iwill multiply this by the number from here. The number which I will put here is48 * 8 which is384. So I wrote 384 here and a reminder is given here to writezero.

Okay, let's do itfurther, then you will understand if I divide 10x into 7x + 3x, thensee, by doing plus we get 10x or by doing plus or minus, we do anything, the answer should be 10x. And when you multiply it should come out to be21 on the axis. And we will write the last term like this.Now, when we multiply these two,what will come out? 7 * 3 =21 and x * x x square. So this is therule. After that, do it the way you do factors this is the rule for dividing the middle term. Thank you."

Okay now see, ifwe can take x\u00b2 from these two, then we will take x\u00b2 fromthis, so what will be left here,our x will be left here, our 3 + here we will take one mango, so what will be left here also,our x - 3.

        "subtitle": "My brother, understand this question very carefully 99 of the students think that the answer to both of them is going to be the same, both of them are equal, butmy brother, I would like to tell you that these two are not equal to each other. My brother, both of them are notequal. It is a matter of great shame that even today in India, after graduation children are not able to solve such basic questions. They make mistakes in this. Do you know what is the correct way? My brother, whenever a power is added like this, then a bracket is placed above it, and then a power is added again, so brother, if there is a power above the power, then we multiply it by the power. Mybrother, after adding the digits, it will become the power of two.4 * 3 = 12, so brother, this will come to the power of two. What should we do in this question, sir? Mybrother, when a power is added above the power without a bracket, then we solve the power from top to bottom. My friend, brother first of all you will have to do the power of three. There is a difference here. My brother, here we are doing the power of three first, do not multiply. So,what will be the power of 4 to the power of three? So 3 * 3= 9 * 3 = 27 * 3 = 81 i.e. 81, so this means my brother, the answer that is going to come here will be2 to the power 81, that is, 2 to the power 81, so my brother, this is the difference between these two, I hope you like the video, the video will play, keep watching the video."

So, divide 17x into two parts in this way.We can write 17x as15x + 2x. Now in the next step, in place of 17x, you will see 15x + 2x+ 5. Now, from here you will construct it but you will check whether the common factors are there in the first term. So, the common factors are there in the first term. by taking 3x from here, you get 2x from here and from the second term you get5. Now, in the same way,in the fourth term, you will see if there are any common factors here If there is no common factor then you will start with one and write it after the other two terms.

So, we know that the square of two is four, we will write it on the rightmost side here. Now in the second step,we have to do the multiplication of both the numbers, that is, by doing 1 * 2, we will get two. Now, to find the square of this two, we will get 44, which we have to write in the middle here. Nowin step 3, we have to find the square of the number given on the left hand side, that is one here and our answer is 144."

We have to find the left deli and consider it zero. We have to find d point six equal to one and a =2. We have to find out the second order partial derivative and find which is given. we have dx = delta, we have delta /2- delta dex = delta a and we get deli=36 which is positive.

These are the shoes which after doing some research we found out that these are running shoes whose average height is about 11 cm. it occurs.Now we can see that shobhit is standing with his legs slightly wide apart. So i measured the angle between its leg and vertical height with the protector and it came out to be 2.3\u00b0.After that, with the help of the length of the shoe, I measured the distance between the leg length and the straight line.So it came to 3.4 cm. So if we analyze this triangle, we have the height and the angle of elevation. So weput these values \u200b\u200bin the sine formula and found the length of its hypotenuse it came out to be 84.79 cm. And the total length with shoes is 95.79 cm. now when I measured the ratio between shirt to shoe and shirt to head,it came out to be 10:1 and here the value of 11 is 95.79 cm. So with its help I calculated the value of 10 also which came to 87.08 cm. finally after getting the values \u200b\u200bof both, when I added them,our final height came to approximately 182.87cm. Which is nearer to 6 feet. So height of shobhit bhaiya should be around 6 feet."

So,we will write -23y\u00b2 as 22 because there is a negative sign here, so the negative sign will have to be maintained and we will write - 22y\u00b2.Now, if we put -y\u00b2 with -2y\u00b2, only then it will become -23y\u00b2. Are you saved now? y first and second we will take common. We will take common in third and fourth.

Our rational numbers arein fraction form, even though the denominator can not be 0, and a and b are coprime numbers which are only one and appear in our table. The first question for us is \u221a2 is also equal to a, so we will square it on both sides. We will get2b\u00b2 = a\u00b2, so a\u00b2 is divisible by 0. If a\u00b2 is divisible by 0, then a will be divisible by 0.This is our 1.23m, in which we have already proved then we will take a and c. If c isany one positive here, then we will put it in the first equation so what we get is 0squared = 4c squared, then after cutting it becomes b\u00b2 = 2c\u00b2, so here also ourb squared is divisible by 0 andb will be divisible by 0. In 1.23, the common factor of a and b is2, but in cobras, the common factor can not be a rational number, which means our assumption is wrong and the root of a is a rational number."

If you are doing thistoday, then you are not as intelligent as you think you are because if you do not do your ncert first and before that you jump to french books, then you are wasting both your time and energy second is rd sharma Bhaiya. RD sharma book is verygood, it is a very legendary book, but when you have to do each and every question of ncert starting a chapter with RD sharma is the most foolish thing that you can do because you do not have that much time asyou need to cover so many subjects right now.And the third book is your NCERT itself. Hey Bhaiya, what are you saying ncert is the most important, it is absolutely important, but if you are following NCERT If you have studied the same NCERT and are reading the same NCERT 10times, then it will not improve your marks.Read the NCERT once or twice and then practice the questions because NCERT does not come in the exam. the questions made from ncert come in the exam, so do in-text and back questions and practice other questions i will upload the PDF etc., you guys will get them."

Okay,now look here, different temperatures are given on all sides and the temperature of a junction is asking why the temperature of a junction is so low. to find out why,we use this method in books forever We have an easy technique it is so easy that you will be surprised. Justhere, if you want to find out the temperature of the junction then find out the average of all, that is, if you add all the temperatures from all sides, if you add all these things, then you will get 330 divided by 4,you will directly get 82.5. If you want, you can check it."

We have to find out the equivalent capacitance between this point and this point. the potential of this point is V. consider this point aszero. So, how much capacitor is there between V and zero. So,if this is V, children, then there isno need to calculate from here. So, how much will this potential be?And here the potential is zero,so this potential will also be zero. So, there isa capacitor between V and zero,this is ours. Okay, there is one capacitor between V and zero,and ours is placed another capacitor is placed between V and zero meaning all of these are connected, children, they are between the same potential difference meaning if there is same potential difference then it means parallel combination so this"

        "subtitle": "In board exams, 20 out of 100 marks arein the hands of your school teachers. So,if you also want to get full marks from your school teachers without studying, then apply these ninja techniques number one,praise your teacher in front of the entire class,like Sir, yes kuldeep Sir, I actually wanted to thank you, you teach as well as you do, I don't think anyone in this entire school teaches even close to you, Sir, what about the entire school, I think not only in this entire city, but in the entire country, Sir, you are the number one teacher, Sir. Second, always keep asking your doubts to the teachers, this will make them think that they are very intelligent and you are very stupid, and because you are very stupid they will definitely lie to you by giving you extra marks great planning. Third, always sit on the first bench in the class, whether you understand anything or not, always do this or that. fourth develop a family like relationship with the teacher, like Sir, Mummy specially made potato par at has for you and sent them, bring it, bring it, bring it, and finally,if none of the tricks work, then shamelessly go to the teacher and say, oh Sir, see, by the way Itis difficult for me to pass but if you do not want to have to face this problem next year also then please pass me properly your dear backbencher"

From here you will have to bring -3 closer to -5. Keep in mind that when it crosses the bridge of equals, it will become -3 here. If we subtract 3t from 5t, 2t will be left.Here -5 + 3 will subtract one minus one plus. the sign will come before the larger value. If we subtract 3 from 5, then two isleft. Five is increased, so the minus sign comes before five. We have to find the value of t.Now see, if webring it to the other side in multiplication with t, then in division, it will be -2 / 2, it will cancel out, the answer will be minus 1, so t =-1."

First of all,we can fill the cone till the top with anything.I have done that by putting it here. So, friend, I am filling it inside it for the first time. Oncedone, now in the same way we will fill it till the top for the second time. it should be full.I have filled it inside it. Okay, now in the same way we have filled it till the top for the third time also and filled it inside it.You all can come and see that this cylinder is completely filled till the top. from here it is verified that the volume of a cylinder is equal to the volume of three cones.So if the volume of the cylinder is pi r\u00b2h, then what will be the volume of the cone? 1/3pi r\u00b2h"

If we take this four, then what will it become?x + a = 16 4 * 4 = 16. So,what will this equation become? x + a = 4. If we take x there, then a = what will it become? -x + 4. Okay, now here this minus oneis its slope, that is, it has a negative slope, that is, the graph will be something like this. And +4 is its intercept so +4 we will put a point here andit will have a negative graph. So the graph will come out like this. Now, if we cut at x, then what should a be? 0. So,what will be the value of x? 4 8 a = 0. Meaning, it will cut at four, so this means its graph will be something like this. This will be the final graph."

Now, suppose you went on Shark Tank and got a deal like this: 50lakh for 10% equity and 5% royalty on sales until 2x. This means that Shax has valued your business at 5crores, from which he is asking you for a 10% share of the business by paying \u20b91 lakh.But he also wants a royalty of 5% on every sale, or in simple words, a commission of 5%. Meaning, if you sell 1 crore rupees a year,you will give \u20b91 lakh to Shax, whether you make a profit or not. and how long will you give him this commission Until Shax's invested money doubles meaning he gets 1 crore for 50 lakh rupees with this royalty, sha x reduces his risk and feels a little safer.Look at me. So this royalty concept seems completely fake.What do you think? Do tell us in the comments."

Will it also be one because zero is also a number, a whole number? please tell us about it. similarly they asked, if the value of zero is zero though they meant that zero to the power of zero, then will its answer also be one?Let's find out. We will follow the same steps as in the previous video.I can write zero to the power of zero as 0 to the power of 1 - 1because if one goes away from one, only zero will remain Then Ican write it further like this, by separating the power of 0 and * 0 to the power - 1 separately Now, the same thing here, 0 to the power of one. Now to make its power positive we will bring it down to divide now it has come down to divide.And our beloved mathematician ramanujan has told us that divide by zero is not possible You can not divide by zero.If you try to do it, what will you get? The answer will be undefined So What does this mean? We can say that the value of 0 to the power of zero is undefined but some people also consider its value to be one."

        "subtitle": "Hello friends, today we are going to learn a great way to find any number of rational numbers between two ten rational numbers. what you have to do in this is simply,if you are given two such rational numbers whose denominator is 10, then you simply have to note them down like this.After this, just look, if you want to find five rational numbers, then you simply add one to five and you will get six. you can note it here. Now 3/5 and4/5, you have got the number six multiply six by the numerators and denominators of both and you will get18/30 and 24/30. now you can simply find all the rational numbers coming in between these.You know after 18 comes19, so give 19/30, 20/30, 21/30, 22302330 If you want, you can also simplify it tozero. Zero cancels 370 and you divide it 11 times simply write it down 15 times, 19 / 30 / 37 / 10 11 / 15 and 23 /"

It means it will become2 * 4. Here it will become 5 * 4.Talking about this, 3 * 5 and here it will be 4 * 5.Finally, this becomes my 8/20 and this becomes my number 15/20. Now we have to find out the rational numbers between 8/20 and 15/20 and those rational numbers will be9/210/2 up to14/2.

It is said that4 years before the presidents age, the forward ratio of A and Bwas 4:5 and 8 years from the present, the forward ratio of A and B is 11:3.Tell me the ratio of their presidents image. Children, it does not seem to be taken forward. If you tell me, it comes from the front only, isn't it? Look here, there is a gap of 4 to 117. Here, there is a gap of five 13 and eight. So, this iswrong. So, brother, we have to make the gap equal.And there is a gap of one between the five ratios. There is agap of two in 11 13. So, we will reverse multiply the top by two and the bottom one by two above.Two four eight two paws will become 10. Look, how big is this 8 to 11, 3 units? How big is this 8 to 11, 3units for B, 10 to 13,3 units ahead. whereas the gap is how many years ago, 8 years later, 12 years. the value of three hits is 12 years. So what is the value of 4 years my love, one unit I asked youin the present, so do not calculate it further, from here the tax year is a, so present is 4 years means one unit, so one unit will be added to 8, one unit will be added to 10, 11,so if you want to calculate the ratio of president match, no ratio 11,then direct it, if you understood this then ask me this question and tell me"

If it comes in your exam, then no brother, you will solve it using options your answer will come out in great fun.How? Pay attention here. It says that the age of the father is four times the sum of the ages of his three children whose age is four times the sum of the ages of the father, brother? the fathers age is four times the age of the children. That means it is clear that the age of the father will be a multiple of four. It will be a multiple of four, that means it will be divisible by four.Now see in this which number is divisible by four. So, brother, 50 is not divisible by four.43 is not divisible by 65. Which number will be divisible by four? So, what will be your answer?

Here we have to write S here, P here, V here,and T here. This is how far we have to work out from P to B. Here I will write H here, G here, A here, and U here. So, which relation do I need? the reaction enthalpy, how will I write itin the form of dx? Equally, what do I have to do whatever relation we have to work out,we have to write the variables around it. For example, if I have to work out the reaction enthalpy,S and P in front of it, then you will write Sand what will you write here, P in front of it,Di and Di. whatever is there here,like less, then hold S from here and see where this arrow is going. wherever it goes, you have to write it. If Agoes in the straight direction, you have to write it in the reverse direction. then you have to write it here and see what will be its direction. The arrow is going to catch Plus B and what will be the direction of the arrow. If it is straight then in which will it be, it will be in plus so what will I write DT = ok it is later here I have written P and here I have written T and D and you have to put D in it. The direction will remain straight read the plus three, see the hero is going in it, whoever writes about the reverse direction like this will be aminus."

So, one goes away from 100.If you see the difference between the squares of these two numbers is one, then when you have to tell the plus, then double the bigger one, that is,double 10, it will become 20.

If we talk about odd number then here the odd ones are 13and 5, that means there are three outcomes which are odd and the total outcome is six, three by six,that is 1/2.

Its boundary around itis the circumference of the circle. the line passing through the middle of the circle from the center is the diameter of the circle when the ratio of the circumference and its diameter was calculated for every small and big circle in the world, it came out to be close to 3.14 every time andwe call this number 3.14 as pi which is an irrational number. Its approximate value in fraction is 22/7, that is, circumference divided by diameter is equal to Pi. circumference divided by diameter is twice the radius equal to Pi, that is, the formula for the circumference of a circle is2 Pa.

If we take the bar above, we have to put all the nines below.Here the bar is for one digit,so we have to put a nine below. Doyou understand Now we need to take the square root of this.And if we take it, see what happens. the square root of four means 2. the square root of 9 means 3.And 2/3. Actually, here again all the answers are in the bar. That is why what we will do now is that we have to take three below, so multiply the above below by three. What we get when we multiply then we get 6/9. And6/9 means now how to write this.06 bar is simply 9. If so, you should put a bar on top. Yes, that's why the answer is 06. Do you like the trick?

So whatever this whole term is, it has to be divided by 17."

C is a positive constant and we need to find the largest possible value of C. Now, if I solve this question on the SAT, I would actually press the calculator button on the testing software and do exactly this.Let's graph the equation. I'm going touse X instead of B here because we know B is supposed to be a variable and it only says C is a constant. And we can graph X - C. Make a slider for C and move the slider until they have thesame. answer seven. Now, the reason why this works is any time two equations share a factor, if you graph them theyll have the same x intercept. so what I did was I just grabbed both ofthem, moved the slider until I found the greatest possibility of C that was still a factor that was still sharing the same exodus as the the red line Thank you."

Now basically how will you do the top 95, the powers that are coming under top 90,you add one up to these powers,see the top 90 will be just simple you are powers, one is power,add one to one, multiply it, add one to the second power multiply it,add one to the third power, so just simple the answer that you get from here will be your number of items."

So,a lucky doctor got a chance from the government to do the postmortem which is done after his death. the doctors name was thomas Stoles. they removed Einstein's brain from inside his head during the postmortem And anyway, while burying their bodies, noone will check whether they have a brain ornot. He took it out and stitched it.Without the permission of Einstein's family, so tospeak, he stole his brain. You won't believe it research was done on that brain for 40 years. the full report came in 1990. He died in 1955. The report revealed that his brain was asymmetrical If Itake out your brain and cut it from the B, the size of both sides will be thesame, right? It will be a little different. But Einstein's left side was bigger.So that out of the world and asymmetrical thoughts come into their mind. genius thoughts came automatically Secondly, IPS was big in his mind. Thatis, the part that controls maths. Thirdly, his prefrontal cortex was larger.So his focus was very sharp.

If one is on the left, the other should be on theright, and if one is above, the other should be below. So, in such a case, all the angles formed are equal clearly for example, if Ilook at three, the angle of three is formed in this way because it is on the left, and the angle of five is formed downwards to the right. so brother three and five will be equal clearly because here this z is being formed see this z is being formed, so both of them will be equal. Similarly, the angle of four is on the upper right,and the angle of six is \u200b\u200bon the lowerleft, so for this reason, the angle of four will be equal to six. here also z is being formed clearly. So,in such a case, we have two pairs of alternate interior angles that are equal three is equal to five, and four is equal to six quickly comment.

After that, you will see from here, from here you willsee, see this triangle has become nine, that is,how much has it become? 10, the none triangle from here, this becomes 11, this much has happened after that, friends, you will pay attention here,after 11, our 11 is already done.Okay, now from here, from here, this will be your 12 triangle, after that, from here, from here,one triangle will be formed, this will become 13, this will become13, after that, at last The bigger triangle will beformed, meaning 14, meaning there are a total of 14 triangles in this figure."

So the value of \u03b1xis 5. The value of n is plain so it will be10p. It will come below this. So p = 5 /10 5 / 10. After finding this 1/2 3,why find one minus b one minus oneby, then you will get 1/2. You have to find the variance. The value of variance isnp. So the value of n is 10. The value of p is1/2. This is also your 1/2. So this will be10 / 4 which is nothing point five. So option B is correct."

So here there is a man who hits the target five times out of eight,so the probability of hitting is 5/8 and the probability of missing is 3/8. So if he fires the shot 10 times, then you have to tell the probability that he is hitting the target twice. so select two shorts from 10 shorts and ifyou make the two shorts you have selected hit the probability of hitting was 5/8 and if you make the remaining eight shorts miss then the probability of missing was 3/8. This will happen eight times. So you solve it,now write it as 10 * 9/2, this is your 25 and this is your 3 to the power 8 up to the power 10, so the calculation that comes out will be your Boption, if you want to read the probability in detail, then I have pinned the video here, you can go there. can be seen from"

In this, in bernoulli you can get only two outcomes, either successor failure. If you are giving an exam, then there can be only two outcomes it is applicable for a finite number of trials and it is applicable only for a finite number of trials. the probability of success is the same in each trial. For example when you toss a coin, the probability of getting a head or tail is50% or 50%. similarly you can say about the sex of any baby, either it is male or it is female. wherever there are two outcomes, if you have such data, then what can you say that this data under bernoulli distribution ok it's coming thank you"

Now we will put x = here.So pi of 2 = 2 * 2\u00b2 - 3 * 2+ 5. Now we will solve this. What will be the square of4? 4 * 2 = 8 - 3 * 2 = 6 + 5. 8- 6 2 + 5 is 7. So here what is the value of this polynomial that we have got, 7 plus the value of x when 2 * 1 so pi / 2 = 7"

Yes, now to convert one back into percentage we will multiply it by 100.Okay, so the square root of 100% will be1 * 100, that is, 100%, same. Yes, please comment on its answer."

Then you will say Sir, its fraction will be 4/9. If we find its square root, then what will come my child, 2/3. Now you have to make a recurring digit again, so in up, either make 9or 99 or make triple 9. I can make nine,how can I multiply below three and above three, then it will come up to6/9 and 6/9 can be written as 0.6 pebar. So that is your answer. Many children will think that the square root of 4 bar will be0.2 pe bar. It is not like that. You have to first make the fraction and then solve it."

So what is a s in the first column, so how much is a,what is the square of 3 3, nine, okay?What is the second one, 2ab, so how much is a, how much is 3 b, we will multiply it by two,okay? So this will be yours,2 m 3 * 5, that is, 5 * 3 15, 15 * 2 30,so this will be yours, okay? Next,what is b squared, what will be the square of 5 5,25, okay?After that, you have to take its unit digit and whatever is left with you, you have toadd it to the next column, so when you add it, this will beits 32. You have to take the unit digit also and whatever is left has to be added to it, if you add it further then this will be your how much is 12, right? So here you have to take both these digits so this will be your how much is 12, take its unit digit, how much istwo, take its unit digit, how much is five right So this will be your answer."

Guys, whenever you are asked decimal to binary, what you have to do is start counting from one. Then wecan double one, double two, double four, four, double 8, double 16, double 16,double 32, double 32,double 64. This has to be done till the number given in the question is smaller or equal to the first step second step, by adding which of these numbers can we get 93? 64became 16, our 80 became 88, 92 and this became 193. So, the digit which you are using in the addition will have one below it and the rest of the digits which you are not using will have a row below them. This is the simplest way of decimal to binary.

That means alpha+ beta and product of zeros means alpha * beta. So on solving this polynomial one of its zeros came out to be two and the other zero came out to be three. So here alpha = 2and beta = 3. So alpha + beta becomes 5 and alpha * beta becomes six simple"

Now, the value of x obtained from here,you will put it in the first equation. This is how we put3 - 2y in place of xin the first equation now after solving it, you will find the value of a.7 * 2 =14y - 5y = 2. So, this becomes 21 - 19y = 2,that is, 19y = 19 and a = 1. From here, you will get the value of a. By putting it in equation three, you will find the value of x as well. the value of x is obtained from here as3 - 2 * 1, that is, 3 - 2x. value"

If you multiply by 10, then one digital will go before the decimal, right, this is equation one. Think more, if the bar was placed on two digitals, then we would have to multiply by 100 right and if it was placed on three digitals, then we would have to multiply by thousand, and so on, the reason for this is that we have to subtract the digits after the decimal so that when we subtract them, they become zero. So now you will subtract 9x from this and you will subtract 13.0 from this, so the value of x is added. 13/9 and what was X was1.45 and it's simple"

So because here pay two digits are being repeated So in this we will multiply by 100and this becomes 100x =127 points. Like this. This becomes our equation number two. Now if we subtract equation number one from equation number two,we will get 99x = 126, from which x will become126 / 99 which will be 14 / 11 and this is ouranswer."

Okay, if you discounted a cash flow by 12%, then it came to 885. You want the rate at which we discount it. So, we get 90 rupees okay so basically we have one unknown rate and two more rates, 10% and 12%. So, 12% will be the higher rate and 10% will be the lower rate.What will the equation do? unknown - lower rate divided by higher rate - fluorine and diode first if you solve it with this equation you will get a first rate of 90.This is called interpolation In such a situation winter pollution will be there in many places that rate will not be black everywhere In spotts model, the will come for you. remember that unknown - lower divided by higher - lower equals you."

PV has to be selected keeping your running age in mind suppose your basic pension is 200200half of your basic pension is100100 and suppose your age is 36, then according to this chart your PV becomes 9.13 6.So after calculating with this formula, your quit amount comes to11723.

So here the total fare is \u20b9y for the first hour and after that \u20b910 is being charged for each subsequent r because we have already written the fare of one hour here, sowe will subtract that and R from the total time and when we solve it, this equation will become our form now because it is in standard form"

Here again we will try to make the left hand side and the right hand side equal by applying power four.We can write 64 as 8 to the power 4.As soon as the power jumps here,we can do this. And here wecan also bring down this power four.Here you can see that x to the power 4 is x to the power 4. So you have raised 4 * 2 to this 8. Now x to the power 4 is the same thing to the power 4. Same thing tothe power 4. That means box, these two boxes, what have both these boxes become? Both the boxes have become the same. It simply means that x to the power 4 = 8 and x = Power 4right here this is your answer and yes B is your correct answer I hope it is clear"

Now if we square the number we subtracted we will get the last two digits 81. So our answer will be 8281. Similarly, 89is 11 less on base 100, okay, 39 - 11 is 78 and the square of 11 is 121, which is a three digit number but we need two digits, sowe will add the one at the 100th place to 78. the square of 89 will be 7921.

Now let's make this equation three.Now put this equation, son,in equation number one, that is, what would we do in place of x?We have already given 4 + y and y + y = 14.Now what happens is 2 va =14 - 4 and va = 10 div ba 2 yet comes down and after dividing by y, the value comes out to be pa. the value comes out to be five. Now what do you do with this value of y?Put it in equation number three,son, and see what you get: x = 4 pa5. And this becomes x = 9.

There is another smallcircle S2 of yellow color which is touching both the coordinate axis and S1. You have to tell the radius of this S2. Out of four options, which will be correct find out the answer and write it in the comment box. Now let's see thetrick. If the area is 36 cm square, then we know its radius and it will besix units. Here, the distance from the origin to its center will besix roots. Now, we can divide this line that you are seeing into three parts. the radius till the center, which is the distance between S2 and the origin, will be equal to \u221a2 r. The distance from here to this point will be equal tor. And the distance from here to here will besix r.R can be easily found by solving this equation write your answer in the comment box."

So this 2x was already there, when we bring x here then it will become minus x is looking equal to two, so apply equal to two. Similarly, this is a constant value from minus. So move this to this constant on the other side of the RHS. keep in mind that here it is minus, so if it goes to the other side the sign will change. Here itis +2 and will remain like this.

If you subtract 58, you can subtract 174 from 58and you will have a new equation,x + y = 3. When you subtract these two,you will get 4x- 4y = 4. And when you subtract 4, you get 4 from 4.Cancel the dog and you will get a new equation x - a = 1. Now you can easily solve both these equations x+ a = 3 and x - a = 1.Please tell me the value of x and a in the comment section."

So there has to be two pigeons that that are close together. Sofor instance if you have 100 numbers and they all range from one to a thousand umtwo of them have to be at most at most10 apart. Mhm. because you can divide upthe numbers from one to 100 into 100pigeon holes. Let's let's say you have if you have 101 numbers 101 numbers then two of them have to be distance less than 10 apart because two of them have to belong to the same pig.

So these three arein product form, that is, in multiplication form.When we put the value, we will put the sign of multiply. So the value of 4 * 5 is22/7 * r\u00b2. The radius is 7.r\u00b2 means if we multiply 7 * 7 times, it will become4 * 22 * \u200b\u200b7. If we multiply all three, it will be 616square cm. The area always comes in square.

Along with this, it is also called the convergence rate of bisection method or we call it order of convergence so it is very slow. That of regular false islinear, that of see ken can be called golden ratio and that of newton depp s method is quadratic and golden ratioi.e. 1.618 because its value is between one and two,so we also call it super linear.I hope you will find this table very helpful"

When you look at this set,you see that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,that is, these are all natural numbers, but which natural numbers are smaller than 7? That's all we have observed Now let's write this in set builder form So, to write this in set form, first of all we will make curly braces for all these elements listed here. We will write them asx. now how are these x's? These x's belong to the family of natural numbers. And also how are these x'ssmaller than 7. So, here we are,we have written the form of this set."

And the second example is they came to help me. Come and to help in the first sentence here we have got two verbs. the verb kam in the first sentence has become kam in the past tense in the second sentence but there is no change in the second verb which is to help.So come is a finite verb and to help is a non finite verb."

Did you see how to stick it?Just connect two wires to both the terminals of its battery one black one, one redone. Keep in mind that the red wire should be putin the plus terminal and the black wire should be put on the other side. Now just bring any one-two watt light from the market apply some glue on this battery and bend it like this. Take a piece of wire and connect it to the negative terminal of both of them. After this take a small switch. You know, i found this lying on the road. I will stick it in this way and connect one terminal to the battery. Do you know how to apply it? Fold the other terminal like this.Take a piece of red wood and hold it up to the light. Then plug it into the switch. please give me alike, friend. That is all. So tell me what should we name it?

Guys, this amplifier board is quite trending and you can see that it looks like a simple music player but it hasa big heat sink at the back and you can give it power from 8 volts to 24 volts.Then you can get an output of 50 plus 50 volts from it.Meaning that if you total it, you can get an output of 100 volts. Guys,in this amplifier board weget in built bluetooth and along with this we also get to see this remote with the help of which we can control it. So guys, if you want, you can also run it with a 12 volt adapter, but for better output,I am going to connect this laptop charger with it.So guys, I have completed all its connections and you can see that the light has also come on in it.So I quickly connect it to the phone and play the song.Come tonight"

And how to attempt the sample papers then see. Be honest with yourself. Donot lie always, that you are doing this, that you have picked up a notebook and am writing the answers after looking at the book. You should not do this at all.

The factor of 10 can be +-1, +-2 or +-5.Now, from these six numbers, we have to select three numbers which, if added, will give the coefficient of x\u00b2 as -6 and if we product them, we will get the constant term i.e.+10. So those numbers are -5, -2 and +1because if we add all three, weget -6 and if we product all three, we get+10. I will write x - 5 * x - 2* x + 1 tricks.

First of all,you will have to find the value of 1 up to \u221ax using rational equation when youdo rational equation, you will get the value of 1 / \u221ax as5 - 26. After that whatever value you are asked to find, you can square it. As soon as you square it,you will get these relative values and \u221ax will cancel out from \u221ax. the square of \u221ax is x 1 /\u221ax = 1 / x. And when you substitute their relative values,-2 \u221a6 + 2 \u221a6 will cancel out and its value will be 12. But pay attention this is the value of its square. If you want to find its value, then please tell me the answer in the comment section."

If p is a prime number and a and p are coprime, coprime means they have no other factor except one. So, for example here 5 and 11, if we look at 5 and 11,11 is prime and 5 and 11 have nothing incommon, meaning 5 to the power 11 - 1, i.e., 5 to the power 10, the remainder will be one.When we divide it by 11, now how can we reach 102 from 10? Wecan take the power 10 on both sides. So, if we take the power 10 here,it will become 5 to the power 100, and if we take the power 10 here, it will become 1 to the power 10. What is 1 to the power 10? one means 5 to the power 100.

The angle at the centre is double and the angle at this point is half. So now tell me what will x be? Half of 110, that is, you understood if you want to find this, then make it half.If you want to find the centre angle and this is given, then make itdouble.

If you see that the difference between the squares of these two numbers is one, then when you have to tell the plus,you double the bigger one. That means doubling 10 will become 20. Ok?

For this,you have to remember two points. The first point is that in a hamiltonian Cycle, the starting and ending vertex should be the same, which means it should end at the same vertex from which it started. The second point is that you have to remember that all the vertices of the graph have to be visited exactly once. For visiting, a depth first search algorithm is used.Now, we have to see the definition of hamiltonian Cycle. So,youcan define it this way: A hamiltonian cycle is a path starting from any vertex and ending at that same vertex, visiting all the vertices exactly once here you have to remember one concept: traveling salesman problem is also similar to hamiltonian Cycle.In traveling salesman Problem, there is an optimal path whose cost is minimum, whereas in hamiltonian Cycle, more than one solution exists. Soin this we use back tracking approach"

The angle is 360degrees because there are three angles living here,so first you have to find its sum and subtract it from 360. In this way, you first found its sum and it became 300 and to find the x one, you have to subtract both and the next one is your 60 degrees."

If we transpose it, transpose means that student, your rows will be interchanged in the columns, that is, 064, your first row becomes the first column your second row here becomes A in place of the second column,and the third row will be in place of your third column, that is, minus four sevenzero.

All three are equal. This is our A1 A2 b1 b2c1c2. All three are equal. Lines are coincident Now we find out the value of x from here. 2x is equal to 8 -3y. The value of x is 8. similarly in the second position also, we put x as 0 once in both the positions. the value of a is found. Weput zero as a and the value of x is found. Both the values \u200b\u200bwill come from your side. When weput this in the graph, then see, if I take x as zero here, then the value of a is 2.6.If I take x as four, then A zero second also like this, another line will come above one line and it will become double this is called line"

Now A is going to be half because in this way, when we find out theslope, then we take the coordinate of B as x1 y1 and that of C as x2 y2. So, we solve Y2 -y1 i.e. 4 - 1 / X2 - X1 i.e. 11 - 1,then half A will be given. If we are showing the slope of both ABC and E as y,it means that these points ABC are collinear points."

When an organism is exposed to some antigen and antibodies are formed inside the body, then we get active immunity from it,but in passive immunity, weput readymade antibodies inside the body so that that organism can get protection from agents active immunity is slow and it takes time to give its full response. For example, when wegot the vaccine, it took a lot of time for us to get immunity but in passive immunity, readymade antibodies have been put in,so immunity is achieved fast, like antibodies are available to a child from mother's milk.

The conjugate of a binomial isthe same exact binomial, with an opposite sign in between the two terms. So the conjugate of the root of 7 plus 2 would be the root of 7 minus 2. We just change the middle sign. What's so great about the conjugate is that if we multiply a binomial with it's conjugate, we just get a number. We won't have any more radicals. For example, if we multiply these two binomials together well just have a squared minus b squared. We square the root of 7 to get 7,and we square the 2 to get 4, 7 minus 4 equals 3. So what do you think would bethe conjugate of these binomials. List those conjugates here. And then I want you to multiply it, the binomial with it's conjugate, to get the product."

So, here we have been given the exterior angles and we have to find the value of x. So, when weadd them, we will get 360 only. So, from here it is very simple that we can find the value of x.Okay, just like you solve any equation, its answer will be110\u00b0. You just have to remember this. Thank you."

So, 17 is between the square of 4, 16 and the square of 5, 25, which is bigger than the square of Cha and smaller than the square of Pa. So, the one which is smaller has to betaken. You should not be interested in this. the square of Pa means nowwe are concerned with five, so it is the prime number before five. You see which prime numbers are there before five, there are two and three. 17 will not be divisible by two.17 will not be divisible by three. So,yes, 17 is a prime number."

Noone can see every aspect because thought by its very nature is limited, butwe should understand the problem as much as possible in a better way,then find a solution to it. Sohow does this happen? This happens by asking questions, not by giving answers you must have noticed that if someone asks me something, then I turn around and ask them questions. First, I have to understand the problem then I will say something. Andin the beginning, you have to do this by writing it down."

Look at this, there isno need to proceed with the short trick. First of all,see what is going to come inside it. There are10 common things inside it like 50.How can we write 50 inside 50? 5 * 10.How can we write 40? 4 * 10. So,what is 10 common inside it? remove 10. If you add10, then what will it become? 2 to the power of five. What will it become? 3 to the power of 4. What will it become?4 to the power of three.And what will it become? 2 to the power of five.I removed 10 from it because there was10 common inside all of them.

If the sum of any two rows, two rows or two columns okay two columns or two of your rows,kids, there are going to be rows here.If you get the sum of them, it is equal to the third, like what is 4 + 13, 17.What is 5 + 19, 24. What is12 and 15, kids, you have 27.If you see this combination anywhere, then you will put the direct answer what is zero, then your direct answer will be zero.You did not need to solve the whole thing.Hope you liked this trick very much.If you understood the trick, then tell us the answer to this question and follow now for such interesting tricks."

These are the shoes which after doing some research we found out that these are running shoes whose average height is about 11 cm. it occurs.Now we can see that shobhit is standing with his legs slightly wide apart. So i measured the angle between its leg and vertical height with the protector and it came out to be 2.3\u00b0.After that, with the help of the length of the shoe, I measured the distance between the leg length and the straight line.So it came to 3.4 cm. So if we analyze this triangle, we have the height and the angle of elevation. So weput these values \u200b\u200bin the sine formula and found the length of its hypotenuse it came out to be 84.79 cm. And the total length with shoes is 95.79 cm. now when I measured the ratio between shirt to shoe and shirt to head,it came out to be 10:1 and here the value of 11 is 95.79 cm. So with its help I calculated the value of 10 also which came to 87.08 cm. finally after getting the values \u200b\u200bof both, when I added them,our final height came to be approximately 182.87cm. Which is nearer to 6 feet. So the height of shobhit bhaiya should be around 6 feet."

It is a simple concept. order of A = 12 means A power of 12 = A.Now what you have to do is, a power of 8, so what should we do is,A power of 12 will go to this part,A part of 8 is 24, which means what is this, 1 power of 24,what can we take this, A power of 12is the whole square, so what is the meaning of A power of 12,A means it is the square of A,so e\u00b2 equals A.

Okay, first of all,what we will do is transpose the variables in this, we have transposed the variables first and after solving this, we transposed the variable okay if the variable is transposed and isin plus, it will become minus and these numbers will go here 1415 will become -1. The LCM will be taken. we took its LCM. We took 6, you know this, we have to find the LCM. Okay, we took six, you divided it by six. 3 in x3divided x3 by six.You got 2 * x. If we did it here also, the LCM will be 20 and 5 + 4 will be given. Okay. plus minus minus so x/6 is five plus four nine is 20 okay we have toput x on the LS side because we have to find out the value of x we transposed six here in divide by 6 a will go in multiply so 9/20* we will cancel out three from you so you three is six you will go zero nine three or 27"

First of all, you should know that the single bond you have is always called your sigmabond. And when I talk to you about double bond then it has one sigma bond and one of yours is pi bond. Andif I talk to you about triple bond, then it has two pi bonds, the upper one, the lower one, and the middle one is yours which bond is your sigma bond? Okay, so let'ssee a question a little quickly now if we talk inside this, then see,this single bond, this sigma bond, this sigma bond,this sigma bond, this sigma bond,and this pi bond. So, inside this compound, you are seeing five sigma bonds and one pibond. Now the next question for you, the answer to which you have to give in the comment box, here is the question"

        "subtitle": "In today's video lecture, I am going to tell you the difference between flat interest rate and the reduced interest rate.Let's say for example you have taken aloan of Rs 55 lakh at a flat interest rate that is 10% for 2 years, then how much interest will you pay, the logic is simple, type 5 lakhhere, okay, into 2 years,turn it into 2, then into 10, right press the 10% button, okay, so in 2 years you are paying \u20b9 lakh interest, so that means how much total you are paying for it, \u20b9 lakh, if I divide this \u20b9 lakh by 24, then how much will it come out,you will have to pay 225000 per month, so if i calculate the percentage how much rate of interest have you charged, then let me do one thing, I am \u20b9lakh *18.1, near about, I am doing percentage so it means that whatever your The interest rate is going to be around 18.1, okay because it is around 1 lakh, you had not paid that much in two years, okay, now I will come to reducing interest rate,see the loan amount is 5 lakh, the interest rate is 10, the loan term is for 2 years, okay,if we calculate this, then see your total interest is \u20b9 3372 and the interest rate is that you have paid only 53000 something in 2 years,but there you were paying \u20b9 lakh interest for 2 years at a flat rate of 10%,it means reducing interest is much more beneficial as compared to the flat interest rate."

See, the rate for one year is 10, so first of all we will take out 5000, remove the percentage at 10, it will come down to100, double zero will be deducted from the double, then the interest for one year will come out to be00, if the interest for one year is 00, then in three years it will become00, that is, option B will be the correct answer."

To remove the last disc that you inserted first,you will have to remove all the discs.

So students we have a trick according to which we will show you how to add them here. So first of all what we do is multiply these two numbers.So 35 which is your A, you can add 15 here instead of 15, there could have been any other number here students this denominator and this numerator will get multiplied from this side and give you 28. now what you have to do is add these two numbers.So by adding 15 and 28, you get43. And here you have two numbers 7 and 5 students you have to multiply these two numbers. So 7 * 5 which is your A, you get35. In this way, students if you have any rational number, you can add them."

If we multiply by two, how much will be there in six, it will be12. Similarly, friends, if we multiply by two in four, how much will be there,ours will be 8. But see, it isnot given in any of our options now friends, we will see how can we take 12 from 6.Friends, if we do the sum of six, then how much will it be? It will be 216 multiply all the three digits of 216 by2 * 1 * 6 and get how much will be there yours will be 12. From this friends we apply the same logic here with four and question mark friends this will be your 64 and if we multiply both the digits of 64 then it will be24 and our correct answer will be B."

Andin this, keep in mind that mark from the inch side and not from the centimeter side because we need to eat big meals so that our figure becomes clear.

So IT is also preferred by many companies. There isno age difference if I talk from placement perspective then why it branch has been introduced now and there are other branches also like CSAI CSDS,all this has been done only to increase the seats of computer Science.So if you get IT also then it is avery good branch."

So, let's take anexample, in the formula of sin a + b, then sine a and cosine also reduce by following unity. If it is a formula of plus, then plus a will go. If it is a formula of minus, then minus a will go. similarly in the formula of cosine a + b, cosine is kept with cosine b and sine a and sineb are separated and here it reduces in reverse direction. If it is a plus, then it is a formula of minus and if it is a-, then it is a formula of plus. So,how did you like this trick and tell usin the comment section"

Let's try once more.If I take a large banana here, you can see that the area is quite large, so the pressure will be very low here. So if i apply force on it, then it is not bursting if I apply a lot of force on it because the area is large, then the pressure will be less. If I apply a lot of force, I am trying it completely is it bursting or not? even if we stand on it, then my weight will be fully distributed in the large area, so there will be a lot of pressure on my feet.You can see that even after having such a large area, I am feeling a lot of pain in my feet.

I have created risk management for all of them here.If you write a PDF in the comments, I will send this video directly to you. For example, suppose you have a capital of 10000, you want to start trading with 10000, and you want your maximum daily loss to be 500, so your loss should not exceed that. And you are planning somewhere where the stop loss is being made of 10 points. Sonow what you have to do is divide your daily risk by your stop loss. Our daily risk is 500. If we divide itby 10, then it comes here. 50 If webuy 50 quantity and our stop loss of 10 points is hit then our loss will be only 500. Now if you proceed with 1:3 risk reverse ratio then your loss will be 500but if you make a profit then your loss will be around 1500."

It passes through the center this line joining any two points on the circle is a chord. Here's an arc, a curved portion of the circle. And this shaded part between two radi is called asector. geogra makes it super easy to visualize and learn geometry try it now and make your own circle model today."

After this putty dries,I sanded it properly so that it becomes completely smooth. and after all that, I am not joking,my condition has become so bad. I am not even kidding and look, now I am finally adding acrylic colors to the white paint.And after this perfect pink shade is achieved my painting has also started man I did not think when i started this video that it would take so much hard work.If you want to paint this second, then quickly make lots of pink hats. Leave a comment and I'll see you soon, bye."

Okay, andit will satisfy the same four properties that metric space, okay, geometric space okay so we will call itnorm. We will call it domain and we will call it codomain.

So, you understand can't be divided what is the second definition It has no dimension This is a point that has no dimension. Okay, and were present a point in this way, in the form of a dot.Okay, now let's look at the second definition in the second definition it is written: A line is a breathless length. So, first of all, let's draw a line.Okay, so it is saying that this line does not have breath okay a line has no breath. So, it does not have breath.

Then I took a pulley belt and placed it inside the motor. This is the speed controller of the DC motor after connecting the motor wire and the battery wire in it, Icut out a design of this type from thermocol. Onits back side I pasted a pulley after placing these two wheels inside the stand, I took a thread and made a belt by connecting the motor pulley and the wheel pulley together if you want a customized version of this DC motor speed controller then you can order PCB from Jai. just upload the circuit file here and after selecting the color quantity, you can order5 PCBs for just $10and you will also get a coupon for Rs.54. You have to enter the website link in the comments now I will run this project and show you,it was quite amazing.If you look at it carefully, you will see different types of flower designs and different types of patterns.

He has average marks in all subjects but 100 out of 100 in maths students and teachers think it's justluck. But when he performs like this in the first year of Inter and second year everyone is shocked. When his friends ask him how he did it,there is a secret that millionaire Alex h or moji told. Alex's father wanted to go to harvard when he was a child. That's when he found a scientific method for his study to crack his entrance exam.He got 99% marks. It came up with a small graph with the score of students in maths on the x-axis and the number of problems solved on the y-axis. the graph line is at a 45\u00b0 upward angle.Like Alex, I also took 20 max question banks and practiced sums for four hours a day for the whole year thats it."

For example, ifwe have this question, look, there are two values \u200b\u200bin it. one column runs from two to six,and in the second column, you have four to 36.You will also have two columns like this. So, here, I'llname this column first, and this column second Out of these two,you have to set one on the x-axisand the other on the y-axis.But which one to do?For this, let me explain a little concept find the range from these range means it starts from two and ends at six. That means,what is the gap between them? If it is four then it is four and what is its gap from four to 36,you set the one with less gap on it and it does not mean that you write this, it does not mean"

Right,if there is any node like this, this, this,these do not have any children, then what dowe call such nodes which do not have any children? We call them leaf nodes. Similarly, such nodes which have one or more children, we call them internal nodes and those which do not have children, we call them leaf nodes or external nodes. Now,what is the height of the tree? I say that you stand on the leaf node and go from there towards which direction, from there you go towards the root node. All the edges that you will come across on the way, that is called the height of the node. For example, if Igo from this leaf node towards the root node Sohow many edges am I getting on the way, if I am getting two edges then what will be the height of this tree, you will have two."

Add 1 to A to get B. Add 1to B to get C. And then for D subtract 1 from A.That\u2019s the hard part -- now you just fill in a pattern of pairs that add up to 9: 5and 4, 1 and 8, 3 and 6, 7 and 2.Throw another 9 in the bottom right, and the remaining boxes are 10, 11, and 12.That\u2019s it -- every way you add up a line youll get 51.And this works for ANY number between 22 and99.Try this on someone they'll think you're a WIZARD."

        "subtitle": "Hello friends, do you know about the universe? imagine what its shape might be scientists have a few ideas. The first idea is that the universe is flat, meaning if you draw two straight lines, they will nevermeet. The universe will keep moving without stopping. the second idea is a round universe If you keep moving in one direction, you will turn around and come back to the same place.One day, this universe may shrink and end,like a balloon bursting. the third idea is an open universe. It will always keep expanding imagine two straight lines that are together initially, then gradually move apart.Now let's talk about the multiverse and higher dimensions Some theories say that there are many universes besides our own,or perhaps there are hidden places within our universe that we can not see. So, according to what we currently know, the universe is infinite and expanding but what it actually looks like remains a mystery. whether we will know or not, we will learn in the future."

The same thing happens with the Earth and its gravity. But if you squeeze that plant and make it smaller, all the atoms will come very close to each other, due to which you will be able to feel the gravity of that planet evenmore. And if you keep squeezing that planet even more, then ata certain point, that planet will become so small that even light can not reflect from it. And thus that planet will convert into a black hole."

But apart from this, there is also a fact that the timeline in which we are existing is very rare because in the future the moon will move very far from the Earth and atime will come when humans will never be able to experience a solar eclipse again."

You had read in your childhood that there isan alphabet S, so remember that state. the angle that is being made inside it will be alternate interior how will you make it? Wait, the lines are parallel and intersect and transfer. So this shop that is being made isour S shop, so it is an alternate interior angle. So these two angles are equal to each other. Well,this one can also be made with alternate interior in thisway, like this. Okay, so both of these will be made, but the condition is that these two should be made in the middle of parallel lines okay so these will be equal to each other. Ihope you will understand If you liked it, then like it and also share it with your friends."

What is there to do here now?These numbers have to be written here at the top.First we will write eight, then two and then one. Ok? what is there to do here now? This is multiplying eight with five.So here it will be 5 * 8 =40 + 1. So 41 will come here.This has to be written here. Now here we have to multiply this two with 41. So here it will be82. These five are yet to be added to 82. So here it will be 87. now this one has to be multiplied with 87.So only 87 will come here. Plus, we have to add 41 here.So here it will be1128. Ok? So 1128 has to be written here.So what will be the answer here now? Here, the128 that comes at the end has to be written on top as 1128 and below it will be87, okay."
