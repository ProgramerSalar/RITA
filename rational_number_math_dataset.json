Soin today's video we will learn howyou can tell whether it is a rational numberor an irrational number just by looking at it. So a basicdefinition of a rational number is that anyvalue which we can write in the format of p-value isa rational number, that is,I need a fraction or let's sayI need an exact value to call that number arational number. So now the doubt thatmost of the students have is thatwhen a digit is repeating after the decimal,like 0.06 6666 and it keeps going, then is it arational number or a rationalnumber. So friends, this number is anumber with bars, that is 0.666 66,you can also call it 0.6 bar and the bar can besolved in fraction, that is,what is this also, we have a rational number.Now your comment  One irrational number has to be mentioned in the section",
