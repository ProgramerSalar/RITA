Dear students, we have to find rational numbers

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,360
between 3/5 and 4/5. If there are 5

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:12,160
numbers, then by doing plus or minus, we will multiply six up and

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,920
down in both the numbers and

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,920
find the 5 numbers between them.
