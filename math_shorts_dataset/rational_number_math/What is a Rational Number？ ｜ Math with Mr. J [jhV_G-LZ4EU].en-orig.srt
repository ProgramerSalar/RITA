00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,400
this is math with Mr J let's take a look

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,319
at rational numbers now rational numbers

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,559
are numbers that can be written as a

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,400
fraction of two integers or if

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,639
something's in decimal form and it

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,799
either terminates or repeats it's

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,840
rational for example let's jump into

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,640
number one where we have five can we

9
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:24,560
write this as a fraction of two integers

10
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:28,279
yes for example 5 over 1 or

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,480
25 over 5 or

12
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:33,559
50 over 10 all of those are examples of

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,559
fractions of two integers that equal

14
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:39,200
five so five is a rational number for

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,600
number two we have 910s this is a

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,520
terminating decimal so right away we can

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,879
see that this is rational but let's

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,520
write it as a fraction of two integers

19
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:55,719
we can write this as 910th so 9 over 10

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,719
18 over 20 and so on 910s is a rational

21
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:01,920
number click here for a more detailed

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,920
explanation until next time peace
