00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,520
Majority of students know the difference between rational and

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,399
irrational numbers. So

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,400
in today's video we will learn how

4
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:12,519
you can tell whether it is a rational number

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,000
or an irrational number just by looking at it. So a basic

6
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:16,880
definition of a rational number is that any

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,960
value which we can write in the format of p-value is

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,359
a rational number, that is,

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,199
I need a fraction or let's say

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,560
I need an exact value to call that number a

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,279
rational number. So now the doubt that

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,039
most of the students have is that

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,719
when a digit is repeating after the decimal,

14
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:36,040
like 0.06 6666 and it keeps going, then is it a

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,559
rational number or a rational

16
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:42,360
number. So friends, this number is a

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:45,239
number with bars, that is 0.666 66,

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,600
you can also call it 0.6 bar and the bar can be

19
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,199
solved in fraction, that is,

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,160
what is this also, we have a rational number.

21
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:56,000
Now your comment  One irrational number has to be mentioned in the section

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,000
