1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,540
now for again class ninth represent

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,880
minus 2 upon 7 on the number line

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,540
generally question class seventh eighth

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,540
ninth which is

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:18,240
so first of all we draw the number line

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:22,580
and take some integers take a negative

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,580
integer minus fourthly or positive

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,100
so divide all the integers by seven

9
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:35,040
so where is minus two by seven

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,559
here

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,559
this point P represent minus 2 upon
