Now the question comes,what will be the value of n, so thevalue of n will be equal to the number of your terms,how many terms are there, 1, 2, 3 and 4, so here the value of n will befour, so two to the power 4 minus1/2 to the power 4, okay, so if we write three, thenwhat is four to the power of two, two to the power 416 - 1 and 2  What will be the power of four to16, then you will say Sir, if three is divided into the power of 16 thenyour answer will be 15/16, okayjust tell me the answer in the comment box.",

Now whenever these people collide with each other,universal forms are formedand then those universals expand.Some universes have plus positive energy, someuniverses have plus negativeenergy, which means they are either expandingor contracting.

That's whyI am going to tell you all theeighth rule, solook at it carefully and learn it and make a previous thatwe have 1608, so if thelast number of this is divisible by 48, that is, thewhole numberis divisible by 28. Here,if you divide all the eights by 600, 800, then 85656 istaking 848, considering that thewhole number below that number is divisible by 28, in this wayyou can check the second one, 840and the remaining 556, this also becomes divisible, thisis also divisible and this one is notdivisible, 472 and the charge should not be taken from there,which is not going down and everyone should check34 marks on this line.

Now you said, Sir, seehow will you find out whether it is divisible by seven or not? Therule of seven is very brilliant.I said, in the rule of seven, you don't have to do anything here. First of all, you have towrite whatever number is given here.And here, 2, 1, 3, 7, you have to keepsubtracting it again and again by doubling its unit digit.How to understand it? For example, supposehere, seven is here, how much will the double of seven become? 14. So,what should you do here? Subtract 14 from this.If you subtract 14, how much will it return?119 will return. Then after that, herein 199, which is our 9, now multiply it by two and subtract it from theremaining numbers. So,see the double of nine. For example, if 9 issubtracted from 9, then 19 will return. Now, subtracttwo times this nine from 19, 18. So,your result is one.  If it is there,it means some reminder is there and ifsome reminder is there, it means it isnot separated from us.",

        "subtitle": "Whenever you want to check any number whetherit is divisible by seven or not, whether itis divisible by 11 or 13 or not,you don't have to do anything, you have tomake the product of three here and thentake their difference, whatever differencecomes, if you check the rule of seven thendivide it by seven and see, it should be completelydivisible, if it is completely divisible thenthat number is divisible by seven and if it isnot divisible then it is not divisible, my brother, so in thesame way we have to check here, sothis is our question number one,which number is divisible by seven, somy brother, see here, calculate the product of three numbers,subtract 3 from 739, what will it become, it will become736, divide it by 7, it will go beyond 7,our 36 willnot go beyond 7, that means this will not be our answer,okay, so if you like the video then you mustlike it andalso subscribe to the channel",

So such questions keep gettingasked in JEE Main.  This is a question from JEE Main 2020.So if you solve this question using thetraditional method, it will take a lot oftime.  Iwill tell you the trick.  You should know the formulas for the trick.So what does the trick say?  We have beenasked about the dimension of energy.  And there is energy andwork is done.  What is the formula for end work done?  Force * Displacement.Ok?  We will write the force as it is.What is displacement?  Speed \u200b\u200b*Time.  And what can we write next to speed?  Velocity * time can be written asacceleration * time.  So our answer will bef a t\u00b2.  So this is ouroption B is the right answer.  So quicklyhit me with the answer to this question in the comment section.  And subscribe to the channel for such videos",

Both of them were minus orsome children have told us that there was anoption to put it in minus there.  Somechildren have said that they felt thatinstead of adding -2, they just had to add two.

Numbers never determine life.China has prepared its youth for the worldand India has prepared its youth for exams.So Chinese students arebecoming global CEOs, innovators and creators,and we scroll through Reels on Instagram.Let me give you an example.Sundar Pichai didn't just chase degrees, hechased skills.  That's why he leads Googlenot because of a rank in class 12th.  Butyou don't change.  You follow the same old thinking.Just get the degree and then get a job.Because if you change, the world will startfearing you and perhaps you will become the personyou are jealous of today.  The choice is simple.Either you will keep running after numbers orwith skills, knowledge and mindset you willcreate a life that 90% of the youth of India dream of.  Thechoice is yours.",

Now see where did this amountcome from? Bitcoin's godfather Satosh Naka Motji had brought a monetary policy in Bitcoin's algorithmthat this price money will behalved every 4 years, which is called the harvingevent. Earlier,50 Bitcoins were received for mining one block. In 2012, aharving event occurred and after this, this amount was halved to25. In 2016, it became 125.In 2020, it became the 6th. This year,on 19th April, another harving event occurred,after which this amount also halved.In the year 2140, the last harving event will be conductedin Bitcoin's algorithm,after which the marketAll the 21 million bitcoins in supply must have beenmined. Now,what is the concept of block mining? For this, you will have to know whathappens inside a block. I willexplain it in 1 minute. Click below.",

Okay, sowhat I can do in method one is find theargvectors. Then arrange themin columns. You will get p. Butthis is a rather lengthy method. So, I ammoving to method two. Check with the options.What will I do? I will take option number one. I willmultiply option number onewith the matrix. After multiplying it, this is what I got.Now seeif I can create option number one again by taking some common values \u200b\u200bfrom this.So what I did wastake -1 common from the first column.  From the second -1 from the third 2and I get the same matrix which is inoption number one. What does this mean?

Today we will talk aboutdiagonalization of matrix.So first of all let me tell youwhat is the meaning of diagonalization?One of his methods is to convert a square matrixinto diagonal form.That's called diagonalizationusing the eigenvalues.  Its formula isa = pdp inverse a pdp inverse.   If youconvert it into diagonal form in a tough matrix, then it makes thecalculation easy for you.  Now the question is whetherevery matrix is \u200b\u200bdiagonalizable?  You can tell me its answer in the comments.And that was it for Day 18.  Ifyou have any doubt then you can tell me in the comment.[music]",

This equation istrue for all values of x except for whenx= 2 a. And we need to find what thevalue of a is. Now, if I solve thisquestion, I would actually press thecalculator button on the SAT testingsoftware and do this. Since the questionasks us to find the value of a constant,we can just type in the equation inregression format like this, and it willsolve for all the values of theconstants in this equation.And we need to make sure a is true forall the values of x not just x equal z.So let's just set x a bunch of numbersdesmos knows to make a true for allthese values. And the answer is3. Thenthe question also says that x cannotequal 2 a. So we can take that in desmosto see what that value equals. 2 a isequal to -2/3. And we see the values weset for x none of them equal -2/3. Sowe're safe from that end. We don'tcontradict anything in the question. Anda=3 is definitely the answer.",

At that time I wasstudying Calculus which is a subject of class 11-12.At the age of 800, heobtained a degree in Maths.  At the age of 20,he completed his PhD.  At 24 healso became a professor at UCL.  There wasan unsolved math problem for 50 years.  AidosDisprepancy.  Isolved that problem also in 2 months in my free time.When people get a job of \u20b930,000then it is \u20b92.5.  He was earning lakhs every month as aprofessor.  He also got a wife who is anengineer in NASA.  Don't tell your parents about this, otherwise you know they willscold you.  Look what you have done,what do you have to do?",

It'sa part of the brain called thecerebrum. Because of that, their posture andbalance are very strong,because normal humans don't have it.How can you strengthen it? This is abouttrying some newthings daily. When you're trying something new on your brain.I wake up, it's my habit to pick up thebrush with my right hand.One day, I picked up the brush with my left handand started brushing. A signal will go to my brainthat I did something different. This is something new.How did this happen? Thebrain will be active at that time.When you do new things, the brain learns. Only then do theparts of the brain develop more,and that's what increases your thinking skills.",

I was the one who wassitting on the postman board. All the notes were made. What did Imelt? First of all, I have to make at least two colorchanges, one of which should be black and one should beblue. If you want to write something important, thenit should be lighter or red in color. Youcan put it in a panel, like you can put a star on it.This can emphasize the important things.Secondly, if there is some extra thing inside the note,then it shouldnot be dragged inside the note. We can take a poster. If you want towrite that thing and some extra information, thenput it on the page and on top of it we can make a train.Third,make short forms for everything like if you want to write on the exam, then for thatwrite easy minimum. For that, for remindermaximum, we can make a chart for it. If any other wordcomes repeatedly, thenmake a chart for it.  So, you have come, these tips must be helping you too.That's all for today, we will see thelast moments of Jalan's evening in this video.",

Thelogic behind considering electrical as the second most branch is that electrical engineering has thehighest number of subjectsand to understand all the three core subjects of electrical, powersystem, electrical machine and powerelectronics, realimagination and abstract thinking isrequired.

To find this out,a survey was conducted among different students in different engineering colleges of the worldand the result of the survey told us thataccording to this result, the second most branch in the world is electrical.After electrical,chemical comes next, followed bycomputer science and after that space.According to this survey, the easiest branch of civil and industrialengineering iselectrical. Thelogic behind considering electrical as the second most branch is that electrical engineering has thehighest number of subjectsand to understand all the three core subjects of electrical, powersystem, electrical machine and powerelectronics, realimagination and abstract thinking isrequired. There is a lot ofabstract mathematics application here too, whichmakes the branch the second most.",

Because inEndgame, Doctor Strange easily opened aportal from Titan to Earth. So whydidn't he do the same thing inside thisspaceship? Here's the reason. This alienship was traveling at light speed, whichmeans Doctor Strange didn't know hisexact location in space. Because ofthat, he couldn't open a portal directlyto Earth. And even if Doctor Strangetried opening a portal inside the ship,the sudden shift into Earth's atmospherewould have caused the ship's internalgas pressure to spike dramatically. Thatpressure difference would compress theship instantly and make it explode,which means they would have been stuckin space or worse, dead.

One means thefirst row and second column.We will hide the first row and second column and whateverelements are left, we will write them in the determinant.471 5. Now we will solve this in the statement.5 * 4 = 20 - 7.

Now whatever is the sum of this position, 13, we willwrite it in multiply. The answer will behow much will we get, when will minus 1 be minus30 * -1.  Of",

Let'ssee here, this is the x-axis plane,two vectors A, C, D are projected on it,we have written its projection on the x-axis and they-axis, what area did these two vectors make, thearea of \u200b\u200bthisparallelogram, the area of \u200b\u200bthis parallelogram will be thevalue of these determinants A, B, C, D. Youcan see herehow are you finding these determinants A, B, C, D, this isA, side D, andwhat will be the total, add and if we remove e from it, thenwhat will be our area,add - e, so in the determinants we have towrite the coefficients A, B, C, D and thecalculations we do are basically area given,so you can understand thedeterminants in terms of area,see this animation is going on, it is a very beautifulanimation, we have easily shown youhow add minus b cforms a parallelogram between these two vectors.His area is",

Theymove in perpendicular direction, thatis, if the electric field direction isin the \u2212A direction andyour magnetic field is in the \u2212C direction, then if it isperpendicular to x, it willgo in the electronegative direction.Because it is oscillating here, sowe already have theequation of A, that is, A is equal to A, thesign of x is theamplitude here, that is, if Ithink about the electric field, then see, theelectric field is increasing andthen decreasing in this way, that means, in place of A,we will write A, in place of A,which means the peak value ofelectric field and then C has the sign ofD, for example, Omega, this means thisvector whose formula is  2\u03c0/\u03bb andomega means 2\u03c0 F i.e.2\u03c0/T. Keep in mind that when you arewriting electric field, itsdirection is A, so you cap here.Similarly, in magnetic field also, there is aminus sign mega. I have given K in it andsee here, there is a cap. So,many times direct questions are asked from both these equations,if this is written then omega is usedfor comparison.

So,in symmetric key, when we have a PT,which is basically a plain text.  Andwhen the encryption is when the sender sendsa plain text, it is encrypted, andit will have a private key, and where as it willconvert into a cipher text, andit will get decrypted and again be sentto the receiver in a plain text.  And inthis case, the private key and private key are bothfor the sender and receiver.  Whereas in asymmetric key, the plain textsent by the sender will get encrypted andit will be a public key and where as it will beconverted into a cipher text andwhen on decryption it will be changed intoa private key and it will be again sent ina plain text format to the receiver inthis case there will be two different keys becausesender is having a public key and where as thereceiver is having a private key.  These are thedifferences between symmetric andasymmetric.  Hashing I Guess You Know It.   That'sit.  Thank you for today's video.",

Eight bit.We will be given an eight bit binary number.What do we have to do in it? We have tofind the ones, how many times is one appearing? 1 2 3 4.How many times is one appearing in it? Four times. Okay,and four is an even number. What did we do?We counted the number of ones and how many times is it appearing?Four and four is an even number. Andwhat priority are we using? If it is an evennumber, we are using even priority, thenwhat will happen in it? There will be no error. Okay, what will happenin it? There will be no error. Now let'slook at the second one. Let's look at the number of ones in the second one. That is,how many ones are appearing in the eight bit number that has been given to us. 1 2 3 4 5.So how many did we have?

There arethree types of ecological pyramids:Pyramid of number, Pyramid of biomass,Pyramid of energy. Pyramid of energy isupright for every ecosystem. The base containsmore energy. As wemove upwards, the energy decreases.Why is this so? Children, because you allknow that the law of 10 states that as wemove from one tropic level to the higher nexttropic level, only energyis transferred at 10. That is why an upright pyramid isformed. In most ecosystems, thepyramid of number, biomass, energy isupright. However, someecosystems show exceptions andinverted pyramids. We willknow what those exceptions are in the next shorts.Stay tuned.  Biology 8th",

The last time it was watered wasin 1972 and it hasn't been watered till now, but still it is alive andlush. But how do you know that in today'svideo, friends, a guynamed Devils planted a plant in a closed bottle in 1962and it was given Agarwal water in 1972, evenafter this it is alive.Friends, the reason behind this is that the model of this plant has anecosystem built inside it.Water is formed, clouds are formed and rain from the clouds falls on thesame plant from which ittakes its details and the only thing itgets from outside is sunlight, itmakes its food with the help of photosynthesisand grows.",

The last time it was watered wasin 1972 and it hasn't been watered till now, but still it is alive andlush. But how do you know that in today'svideo, friends, a guynamed Devils planted a plant in a closed bottle in 1962and it was given Agarwal water in 1972, evenafter this it is alive.Friends, the reason behind this is that the model of this plant has anecosystem built inside it.Water is formed, clouds are formed and rain from the clouds falls on thesame plant from which ittakes its details and the only thing itgets from outside is sunlight, itmakes its food with the help of photosynthesisand grows.",

        "subtitle": "So after a lot of thinking, I have come up witha project idea based on mathematical calculationswhich is also problem solving. For example, let'sassume a road and you must haveseen potholes on the road. They are there due to overloading. Forexample, its weight is 120 grams and weassume that vehicles weighing only up to 120 grams can pass through it. Ifany vehicle weighing up to120 grams passes through it, then the blue light will keepindicating. But if theypass with overload, then as soon as they pass with overload, thebarrier will fall and they will not beable to pass. Then the police will back them upand as soon as they click on the Parveen Sir button, thebarrier will be removed and the otherbarrier, that is, the vehicle can pass on the other road.This is a concept in whichmathematical calculations have been shown. Weightequal to pressure is to switch on. It is fineand a problem solving idea has also been shownwhich willprevent potholes on the road. So, tell us how you liked the idea in the comments.",

At that time I wasstudying Calculus which is a subject of class 11-12.At the age of 800, heobtained a degree in Maths.  At the age of 20,he completed his PhD.  At 24 healso became a professor at UCL.  There wasan unsolved math problem for 50 years.  AidosDisprepancy.

It only getsstretched or shrunk. The amount itstretches or shrinks by is called theigen value.In other words, avals lambda v where vis an igen vector and lambda is itscorresponding igen value. An examplewould be the matrix 3113* the vector 1 1 equaling 4 * the vector1 1. A matrix can only have as many igenvalues/igenvectors as its size. So an n * n matrixcan have up to niggen value vectorpairs. Follow for more.",

Buthow does an object actually become a black hole?Look, all matter has gravity, andgravity depends on the mass of the object and its distance. Thefarther away the matter is, the weaker its gravity.For example, when youstand on a plant, your bodyfeels the gravity of all the atoms of that plant,even thefarthest atom of that planet.Because of this, you are standing properly on that plant. The same thing happenswith the Earth and its gravity. But if yousqueeze that plant and make it smaller, all theatoms will come very close to each other, due to whichyou will be able to feel the gravity of that planet evenmore. And if you keepsqueezing that planet even more, then ata certain point, that planet will become sosmall that even lightcannot reflect from it.  And thus thatplanet will convert into a black hole.",

At that time I wasstudying Calculus which is a subject of class 11-12.At the age of 800, heobtained a degree in Maths.  At the age of 20,he completed his PhD.  At 24 healso became a professor at UCL.  There wasan unsolved math problem for 50 years.  AidosDisprepancy.  Isolved that problem also in 2 months in my free time.When people get a job of \u20b930,000then it is \u20b92.5.  He was earning lakhs every month as aprofessor.
